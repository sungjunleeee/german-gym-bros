# German Gym Bros

A fitness application for generating and managing workout plans for squads.

## Quick Start

We provide a setup script to get you up and running quickly.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will install all dependencies for both the backend and frontend.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up the environment manually, follow these steps:

### 1. Backend (API)

Navigate to the API directory, create a virtual environment, and install dependencies.

```bash
cd apps/api
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Frontend (Web)

Navigate to the Web directory and install Node.js dependencies.

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
```

## Running the App

You need to run the backend and frontend in separate terminals.

### 1. Backend (API)

The backend runs on port `8000`. The database is automatically initialized on startup.

```bash
cd apps/api
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

### 2. Frontend (Web)

The frontend runs on port `3000`.

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

## Environment Configuration (Optional)

### Frontend (.env.local)

Create a `.env.local` file in `apps/web` to configure the application. This is useful if you want to test on mobile devices connected to the same network.

```bash
# Replace localhost with your machine's local IP address (e.g., http://192.168.1.5:8000)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
